My first milestone project for Code Institute - User Centric Frontend Development
This site is designed for a podcast/vlogged dnd groups that live stream their sessions on twitch and also have a podcast available for their episodes on various platforms as well as an archive on youtube.
For the most part the site is meant to give people an idea of who the players and their characters are, along with some background to help people catch up on the story so far without having to go through the entire backlog of episodes
## UX
This website is meant to be a quick way for people to get introduced to a virtual podcast/video stream for a game. The main section of the landing page is meant to breakdown the core names of different groups and provide a quick overview of the settings. Whereas the aside section has details on a timeline of the game with certain key events.
Additional pages are setup to introduce viewers to the characters and the palyers allowing them to learn a brief bit of history about the individuals in the game.
The footer specifically keeps an area active where visitors can see the various social media where they can keep up with the group and subscribe for future content.

## Features
### Existing Features
Social Media Links - Allows users to keep in touch with the group and follow them on SM in order to meet other fans.

## Technologiest Used

-Bootsrap
    -Used to manage the layout of the pages and simplify the setup of different secionts.

## Testing
Site was tested using the various sizes available on the developer tools in Google Chrome and testing the responsiveness. This did find some locations where embedded images didn't stetch over the entire location and when there were issues with margin's on pages.

## Development
There is currently no development tree
