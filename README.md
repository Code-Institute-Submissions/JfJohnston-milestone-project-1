# milestone-project-1
My first milestone project for Code Institute - User Centric Frontend Development
This site is designed for a podcast/vlogged dnd groups that live stream their sessions on twitch and also have a podcast available for their episodes on various platforms as well as an archive on youtube.
For the most part the site is meant to give people an idea of who the players and their characters are, along with some background to help people catch up on the story so far without having to go through the entire history.
